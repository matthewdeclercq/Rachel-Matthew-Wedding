            <p>
                We're getting married on <strong>Drummond Island, Michigan</strong>! It's a beautiful place, but it's a bit remote. Here's how to get there:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YPo8UuAQ8K7ezV76A" target="_blank">Drummond Island Resort.</a></li>
                <li>Access to the island is via the Drummond Island Car Ferry — just show up and drive on!</li>
                <li>Once you arrive, park your car and enjoy the weekend. No more driving required… or go explore, whatever!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                It will be <strong>late fall in Northern Michigan</strong> and the <strong>ceremony is outdoors.</strong> Check the weather ahead of time and dress accordingly!
